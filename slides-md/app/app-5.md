# Plan for today

- HTML forms
- Handling HTML forms in flask
- Time for QA

# HTML forms

::: {.columns}
:::: {.column width=40%}

Whenever we want to gather data from the user in HTML, we'll use forms.

&nbsp;

. . .

All fields in forms must be inside a **`<form>`** tag

::::
:::: {.column width=60%}

. . .

```html
<form
  action="http://localhost:5000/form"
  method="POST">
 ...
</form>
```

::::
:::

&nbsp;

. . .

We'll put the URL for handling the form in the **`action`** attribute.

. . .

And the HTTP method in the **`method`** attribute


# HTML forms. Fields

**`<input>`** are used for declaring different kinds of inputs from
the user.

. . .

We'll always need to give a unique **`name`** to it and a **`type`**

```html
<input name="user" type="text">
```

# HTML forms. Fields

There are a lot of types of inputs we can use.

[`https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input)

. . .

```html
<input name="pass" type="password">
<input name="date" type="datetime-local">
...
```

# HTML forms. Submit

In order to create a button that submits the **form**, we'll use

```html
<input type="submit" value="send the form!">
```

# HTML forms

## Exercise

Create a simple login form in HTML.  password field, and a submit
button.

# Handling HTML forms in flask

::: {.columns}
:::: {.column width=40%}

We can access data from the `<form>` using the **`request`** object in
Flask:

::::
:::: {.column width=60%}

```python
from flask import request, jsonify

@app.route("/handle", methods = ["POST"])
def handle_form_submission():
    return jsonify(request.form)
```

::::
:::

&nbsp;

. . .

the keys in the **`form`** dictionary are the values we put in the
**`name`** attribute of the **`<input>`**

# Differences between GET and POST in forms

The big difference between them is that, when selecting **`GET`**, the
data will be sent as query parameters (in the URL), while when
selecting **`POST`**, it will be sent in the request body

# Handling HTML forms in flask

## Exercise - paymepal

In this exercise we'll see how can we handle user input via forms.

. . .

>- in `index.html`: create a login form that contains two fields, a `user` and `password`, and a `submit` input too.
>- in `paymepal.py`: check if the user exists in the users dictionary, from the data module.  If the user exists, render `private.html`, and `unauthorized.html` otherwise.
>- in `paymepal.py`: get the transactions from the user if there is any, and render them in `private.html`.

# Recap

- We'll gather data from the user in the front side with HTML `<form>`
- `<input>` comes in several flavours: `type="password"`, `type="text"`, `type="email"`...
- From the server side, we'll receive the contents of the form in the `request.form` dictionary
