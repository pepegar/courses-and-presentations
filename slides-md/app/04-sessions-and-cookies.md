# Plan for today

- Review last day's homework
- HTML Forms
- Sessions and Cookies
- Authentication

# Forms

Forms in HTML are pieces of the UI which we use to send data from client to
server.

. . .

```html
<form action="/handle-login" method="POST">



</form>
```

    <input type="text" name="username"/>
    <input type="password" name="password"/>
    <input type="submit"/>
</form>
```

# Forms

Whenever a form is submitted, it will send an HTTP requests to the `URL`
specified in **`action`**, with the method specified in **`method`**, and
sending the form data in the body of the request

# Receiving form data in flask

```python
from flask import request

@app.route("/handle-login", method=["POST"])
def handle_login():
    username = request.form["username"]
    password = request.form["password"]

    # Now, do whatever you want with user and password, for example, create a
    # new session for the user
```

# Adding login to Twitter for dogs!

\begin{exampleblock}{Adding login to Twitter for dogs!}
Let's add login functionality to Twitter for dogs!!
\end{exampleblock}

# Sessions

There's a feature of most web applications that we haven't yet
discussed, **sessions**.

Session help us authenticate users given some piece of data in their request.
This piece of data can be:

- A cookie
- An API token
- A JWT
- ...

# Sessions & cookies

Sessions can be used to authenticate users by relying on cookies

::: {.columns}
:::: {.column}

Cookies are headers that the server sends alongside the HTTP response,
that the client **will send back** in subsequent requests to that host!

# Sessions & cookies

## Whiteboard

Let's whiteboard the whole flow of cookies and sessions

# Using sessions in flask

sessions in flask are handled by importing the session object from
flask:

```python
from flask import request, session

@app.route("/handle-login", method=["POST"])
def handle_login():
    username = request.form["username"]
    password = request.form["password"]

    # The session object behaves like a dictionary
    session["username"] = username # this way, we can identify
                                   # the user
```

# Using sessions in flask

We also use the session object to log the user out.

```python
from flask import session, redirect

@app.route("/logout")
def handle_logout():
    # removing a session object by their key, like in a
    # normal dictionary
    session.pop("username")
    return redirect("/")
```

# Using sessions in flask

sessions in flask are handled by importing the session object from
flask:

```python
from flask import session

@app.route("/")
def index():
    if "user_id" in session: # session behaves like a dictionary
        return render_template("index.html")
    else:
        return render_template("login.html")
```

# Exercise

## Signing users up

make it possible to create new accounts in barker.  When creating an account,
you must ask for user and password, and hash the password before storing it.
