# Plan for today

- Review last day's homework
- HTML Forms
- Sessions and Cookies
- Authentication

# Forms

Forms in HTML are pieces of the UI which we use to send data from client to
server.

. . .

```html
<form action="/handle-login" method="POST">



</form>
```

    <input type="password" name="password"/>
    <input type="submit"/>
</form>
```

# Forms

Whenever a form is submitted, it will send an HTTP requests to the `URL`
specified in **`action`**, with the method specified in **`method`**, and
sending the form data in the body of the request

# Receiving form data in flask

```python
from flask import request

@app.route("/handle-login", method=["POST"])
def handle_login():
    username = request.form["username"]
    password = request.form["password"]

    # Now, do whatever you want with user and password, for example, create a 
    # new session for the user
```

# Adding login to our users backoffice

\begin{exampleblock}{Adding login to our user's backoffice}
Let's add login functionality to our user's backoffice!
\end{exampleblock}

# Sessions

There's a feature of most web applications that we haven't yet
discussed, **sessions**.

Session in the web allow to create sections of websites that are
private, for which users need to authenticate in order to access.

# Sessions & cookies

Sessions are hold by making HTTP use a special kind of header called
cookie.

::: {.columns}
:::: {.column}

Cookies are headers that the server sends alongside the HTTP response,
that the client **will send back** in subsequent requests!

::::
:::: {.column}

# Sessions & cookies

## Whiteboard

Let's whiteboard the whole flow of cookies and sessions

# Using sessions in flask

sessions in flask are handled by importing the session object from
flask:

```python
from flask import request, session

@app.route("/handle-login", method=["POST"])
def handle_login():
    username = request.form["username"]
    password = request.form["password"]

    session["username"] = username # this way, we can identify the username
```

# Using sessions in flask

sessions in flask are handled by importing the session object from
flask:

```python
from flask import session

@app.route("/")
def index():
    if "user_id" in session: # session behaves like a dictionary
        return render_template("index.html")
    else:
        return render_template("login.html")
```
