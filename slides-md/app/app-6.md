# Plan for today

- Review last day's homework
- flask-sqlalchemy
- Using SQL in web applications

# Homework

Let's review last days' homework

# flask-sqlalchemy

Let's install flask-sqlalchemy in conda

# Object Relational Mapping

**ORM** is a technique we'll use to relate database records to Python
objects.

. . .

::: {.columns}
:::: {.column width=40%}

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  username TEXT NOT NULL,
  email TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

::::
:::: {.column width=60%}

```python
class User:
    def __init__(self, id, username, email):
        self.id = id
        self.username = username
        self.email = email
```

::::
:::

You can see how records in the `users` table could be related to
objects of the `User` class


# Declaring models

Models are classes that we'll use to interact with the DB. We'll
declare them by extending **db.Model**

```python
class User(db.Model):
    pass

```

# Adding fields to models

We'll need to make model fields have the same type as the DB columns:

```python
class User(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    username = db.Column(db.String, nullable=False)
    email = db.Column(db.String, nullable=False)
```

# Object Relational Mapping

Using SQLAlchemy ORM, we can use methods in the class instead of raw
SQL:

. . .

```sql
SELECT * FROM users;



```

```python
User.query.all()



```

# Object Relational Mapping

SQL:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'pepe@ie.edu';


```

```python
User.query.all()
User.query.filter(User.email == "pepe@ie.edu")


```

SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'pepe@ie.edu'
                    AND username = 'pepegar;'
```

```python
User.query.all()
User.query.filter(User.email == "pepe@ie.edu")
User.query.filter(User.email == "pepe@ie.edu")
          .filter(User.username == "pepegar")
```

# Sessions

There's a feature of most web applications that we haven't yet
discussed, sessions.

Session in the web allow to create sections of websites that are
private, for which users need to authenticate in order to access.

# Sessions & cookies

Sessions are hold by making HTTP use a special kind of header called
cookie.

::: {.columns}
:::: {.column}

Cookies are headers that the server sends alongside the HTTP response,
that the clien **will send back** in subsequent requests!

::::
:::: {.column}

# Sessions & cookies

## Whiteboard

Let's whiteboard the whole flow of cookies and sessions


# Using sessions in flask

sessions in flask are handled by importing the session object from
flask:

```python
from flask import session

@app.route("/")
def index():
    if "user_id" in session: # session behaves like a dictionary
        return render_template("index.html")
    else:
        return render_template("login.html")
```

# Using sessions in flask

## Full login example

Let's go through a full login example in **`example_3_session.py`**

# Passwords...

There's something **very wrong** about the database we're creating for
tweeter...

. . .

::: {.columns}
:::: {.column}

![](https://www.interactually.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/picard-facepalm1.jpg)

::::
:::: {.column}

We're storing **PLAIN TEXT PASSWORDS**.  That means that anyone with
access to the DB can see the passwords right away.

# Introducing hash functions

Hash functions are functions that can map arbitrarily sized data to
fixed size values.

There are lots of different hash functions, but the ones we'll care
about will:

. . .

>- be **deterministic**
>- make it possible to guess the **plaintext** given the **hash text**
>- avoid **collisions**

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function>

# hash functions

Hash functions will convert clear text to hashed text.

. . .

::: {.columns}
:::: {.column width=30%}

## cleartext

`p4ssw0rd`

::::
:::: {.column width=70%}

## hashtext

`df984bd56ad2a0df3863b6a0f5230baf520e2b24`

# Back to passwords

The approach we'll follow to securely store passwords in our database
is that we will **store their hash text** instead of their clear text.

Then, when checking if a user has a specific password, we'll **compare
the hashed values**.

. . .

We'll import `generate_password_hash` and `check_password_hash` from
`werkzeug.security`.

# Practice

## Example 4


# Exercise

## composing tweets

Make it possible to compose tweets from the frontend of tweeter
(`exercise1.py`).  It should only be allowed to create tweets for a
logged user.
