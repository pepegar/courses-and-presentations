# Plan for today

>- SQLAlchemy
>- Connecting to Databases

# SQLAlchemy

SQLAlchemy is a Python library to interact with SQL databases. It is included in Anaconda.
 
# SQLAlchemy. Engine

The entry point to SQLAlchemy is the engine. It allows us to specify where is
our database, and how do we connect to it.

. . .

## SQLite

The database we’re going to use ourselves is called SQLite. It’s a good
database for testing purposes, and local storage, since all data is contained
on a single file

# SQLAlchemy. Engine

In order to create an engine, we need to import the create_engine function.

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
```

# SQLAlchemy. Engine

Then, we can specify how do we connect to our DB. In our case we just specify
the file, but we would need to specify server, host, port, username, pass in
other database engines.

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
engine = create_engine("sqlite:///paypalme.db")
```


# SQLAlchemy. Connection

With the engine, we specify how does one connect to the underlying DB, but we don’t yet create the connection.
In order to create the connection, we need to call engine.connect()

#  SQLAlchemy. Connection

Something very important is that, as with files, the connection must be always closed. So we can either:

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

engine = create_engine("sqlite:///paypalme.db")

connection = engine.connect()

# more interesting stuff

connection.close()
```

# SQLAlchemy. Connection

Or we can use a with block! (this is what we usually do)

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

engine = create_engine("sqlite:///paypalme.db")

with engine.connect() as connection:
    # more interesting stuff
    pass

# connection.close() Not needed anymore, `with` closes it automagically
```

# SQLAlchemy. Fetching data

Finally, once we have the connection, we can start executing SQL queries!

```python
# ...
query = "SELECT * FROM users"
users = connection.execute(query)
for user in users
    print(user[0]) # Results are represented as Python tuples
```


# Example

## Let’s explore our data!

# Exercise
 
## Exercise 1

Let’s implement login in paypalme using databases!

# Exercise

## Exercise 2

In the private area, show the transactions for the logged user.

# Exercise

## Exercise 3

Make it possible to create new transactions! Create a form at the bottom of the
private area that receives the data for the transaction and shop.
