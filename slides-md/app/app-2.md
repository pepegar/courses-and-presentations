# Plan for today

>- Flask routing
>- HTTP clients with Requests
>- returning different status codes
>- using request bodies


# HTTP routes

We can also capture part of the path as a variable:

```python
@app.route("/hello/<name>")
def hello(name):
    return "hello " + name
```

# HTTP methods

One can specify which methods the function handles in the **methods**
parameter

```python
@app.route("/hello", methods=["GET"])
def hello():
    return "hi!"

@app.route("/goodbye", methods=["POST"])
def goodbye():
    return "bye!"
```

# Returning JSON

Flask has a **jsonify** function that we can use to convert the data we
want to JSON:

```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify

app = Flask("hello server")

@app.route("/hello")
def hello():
    return jsonify({"message": "hello", "name": "Pepe"})
```

# HTTP

## Exercise

Accept the assignment and clone it **https://bit.ly/3saKAMq**

Let's do the **`tweeter_json.py`** exercise from the homework repository.

# HTTP clients

So far, we've been focusing only on one side of the client-server side, the server.

However, we can create HTTP clients in Python too!

# HTTP clients. `requests` library

We can use requests to get an HTTP response as follows:

```python
import requests

response = requests.get("url")

data = response.json()

print(data)
```

# Status codes

We all know the infamous **404** **Not Found** HTTP status code. 
Apart of it, there are a lot more that are used when developing HTTP
servers.  Some of the most used are:

# Status codes

## 200 OK

Used whenever everything went correctly.

# Status Codes

## 201 Created

Used to give the user feedback so they know the resource has been
created.

# Status Codes

## 400 Bad request

A general error in the received request.  It's used commonly too mark
a request as invalid because of some validation problem.

# Status Codes

## 404 Not found

Whenever the resource requested by the user is not found

# Interlude... Tuples

. . .

We all remember the list data structure, a structure that can hold
zero or more elements of different types.

Well, there's another list-like data structure, called `tuple`.  The
big difference between the two of them is that lists can grow or
shrink in size, with the `.pop` or `.append` methods, while tuples
cannot change their size.

# Interlude... Tuples

```python
my_list = [1,2,3]  # We create lists with square brackets
my_tuple = (1,2,3) # We create tuples with parentheses

my_list.append(4) # adds an element at the end of my_list
my_tuple.append(4) # ERROR! tuple object has no attribute append
```

# Interlude... Tuples

Something else to remark about tuples is that, if Python sees comma
separated values without any surounding (parentheses, curly brackets,
or square brackets), will understand them as a tuple.

```python
tuple_with_parentheses = (1,2,3)
tuple_without_parentheses = 1,2,3

print(type(tuple_with_parentheses))
# <class 'tuple'>
print(type(tuple_without_parentheses))
# <class 'tuple'>
```

# Status Codes

Flask allows returning a **tuple** in any route, in which the first
parameter is the **response body**, and the second the **status code**:

```python
@app.route("/users/<user_id>")
def get_user(user_id):
    if user_not_found():
        return jsonify({"error": "not found"}), 404
```

# Status Codes

See `exercises/translations.py`

## Practice

Let's implement a simple flask server that finds the correct
translation for `hello` in a dictionary of translations.

We want our server to respond to requests to **`/translation/<language>`**.

The dictionary can look like this:

```python
translations = {
  "en": "hello",
  "es": "hola",
  "it": "ciao",
}
```

If the received language doesn't exist, we want to return a 404
response.
