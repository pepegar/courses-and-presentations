# Plan for today

- REST
- REST in the server with Flask
- consuming REST APIs wiht requests


# What's an API

## From Wikipedia

> An application programming interface is a way for two or more computer
> programs to communicate with each other. It is a type of software interface,

# What's an API

Basically, a way of exposing a web server so that it can be used **from other
software components**.

In order to be used from other software components, they must use a data
interchange format.  In our examples we'll use JSON.

# Creating APIs in Flask

## Example

Let's see an example of a REST API in `rest.py`.

run it and visit `/users`

# What's REST

We say an API is a REST API when:

- It uses **URIs for resources**
- It's **stateless**
- It uses HTTP semantically (verbs, status codes...)

# What's REST. URIs for resources

_Resources_ in your API are represented as URIs.

Different operations on them are represented with different HTTP methods on
that URI.

- `POST` for creating a resource
- `GET` for reading a resource
- `PUT` for updating a resource
- `DELETE` for deleting a resource

> We call these 4 operations CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

## Example URIs

```
http://api.pepe.com/games/1
http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instances/0f9304a4-e4f8-4d95-acce-bc92794cf365
```

# What's REST. Statelessness

This means that the HTTP Request must come with everything needed in order to
fulfill it.

## Let's see the impact statelessness has in our server applications

There shouldn't be any expected state left in the server waiting for the next
request.  Traditional session cookies are discouraged, since they exist in the
server's memory, they're stateful.

# What's REST. Statelessness

We can authenticate requests in a stateless way, let's take a look at HTTP
Basic Auth.

```python
from flask import request

username = request.authorization["username"]
password = request.authorization["password"]
```

# What's REST. Statelessness

On the client side, we can leverage requests to use basicauth too:

```python
from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth

response = requests.get(
    create_url("/users"),
    auth=HTTPBasicAuth("pepe", "password")
)
```

##

Under the hood, basic auth passes user and password encoded in base64 in an
Authorization header.

# What's REST. Statelessness

## What's the biggest con of stateless sessions? (passing user and pass per request)

. . .

We'll need to query the DB for user authentication on every request.  JWTs try
to solve this problem, but introduce some other tradeoffs.


# Consuming REST APIs with requests

All HTTP methods can be used with the **`requests`** library.

```python
import requests

requests.get("http://localhost:8080/users")
requests.post("http://localhost:8080/users", json={"a": 1})
requests.put("http://localhost:8080/users", json={"a": 1})
requests.delete("http://localhost:8080/users")
```

# Creating REST APIs in Flask

## Example

Let's go over creating new users in Tweeter together 

# Creating REST APIs in Flask

## Exercise

implement the `GET /users/<username>/tweets` endpoint, that returns a JSON list
of all tweets by that user.

# Creating REST APIs in Flask

## Exercise

Create a endpoint in our API that allows creating a tweet

# Alternatives to Flask to build REST APIs

Nowadays it's very common to use [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
instead of Flask for REST APIs.  It's
inspired by Flask, and has lots of interesting functionality, check it out!
