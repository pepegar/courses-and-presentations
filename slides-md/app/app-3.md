# HTTP request bodies

So far, we've been sending data in response bodies but haven't yet
seen how to receive data from requests.

Something we'll need to consider is that not all HTTP verbs allow us to
set request bodies:

  verb     allows body?
  -------- -----------
  GET      **no**
  HEAD     **no**
  DELETE   **no**
  PUT      **yes**
  PATCH    **yes**
  POST     **yes**

# HTTP request bodies

## Getting request body (server)

```python
from flask import request

@app.route("/get-body", methods = [ "POST" ])
def get_body():
    body = request.get_json()
    print(body)
    return "body received!" + str(body)
```

# HTTP request bodies

## Using request body (client)

```python
import requests

dictionary = {
  "name": "dict",
  "purpose": "none at all"
}

url = "http://localhost:5000/get-body"

request.post(url, json=dictionary)
```

# HTTP request bodies

## Exercise

Modify the tweeter_json example to accept adding new tweets too.  Create the client side code in another file in order to call it.

>- submit **tweets** ({\"user\": \"pepe\", \"tweet\": \"Hello world\"})
>- List all tweets


# Serving static files

Being able to serve static files is vital for websites.  They can be
images, videos, CSS templates, or anything you imagine.

# Serving static files

In flask we can serve static files using the **send_from_directory**
function.

from flask import send_from_directory

```python
@app.route("/images/<image>.png")
def serve_image(image):
    return send_from_directory(
        "images/",
        filename="{}.png".format(image))
```

# Serving static files

## Example

See `session-3/example-1`

# Serving HTML

HTML files, as files of any other type can be served using the
**send_from_directory** function.

# Serving HTML

```python
@app.route("/")
def index():
    return send_from_directory("html", filename="index.html")
```
