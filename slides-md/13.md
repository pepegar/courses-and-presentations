# Plan for this session

>- Handling files in Python
>- CSV files

# the **open** function

We can use **open()** to open a file in Python, we only need to pass
the path of the file we want to open.  Let's say there's a file named
hello.txt in my desktop that I want to open and read from Python, I
can do it as follows:

. . .

```python
file = open("/Users/pepe/Desktop/hello.txt")
```

# closing files

Something very important we must do if we're going to deal with files
is to close them.  Once we've opened them, we can directly call
**close()** on them at any point to close them.

. . .

```python
file = open("/Users/pepe/Desktop/hello.txt")

# deal with the file

file.close()
```

# Reading the contents of a file

Now that we know how to open and close files, we can read the contents
of a file.  Let's do that line by line.

. . .

```python
file = open("/Users/pepe/Desktop/hello.txt")

for line in file:
    print(line)

file.close()
```

. . .

As you can see, we're treating `file` as a list of lines.

#

\begin{alertblock}{Be careful with closed files}
If you try to operate
with a file that has already been closed, you'll see an error.
\end{alertblock}

```python
file = open("/Users/pepe/Desktop/hello.txt")

# In this line we're closing the file
file.close()

# trying to do this will cause an error
for line in file:
    print(line)
```

. . .

```
ValueError: I/O operation on closed file.
```

# Interlude, **with**

there is a useful Python keyword that one can use to make sure that
the file will always be closed, **with**:

. . .

```python
with open("file_path") as file:

    for line in file:
        #do something with line
        print(line)
```

# Handling files. modes

When opening a file, we can choose in which **mode** we open it
depending on how we're going to use it.

![file modes](./img/file-modes.png){width=100%}

# Writing files

We can write into files in a way similar to the one used for reading
them.

. . .

```python
with open('/Users/pepe/Desktop/goodbye.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.write("goodbye y'all!")
```

# Checkpoint

\begin{exampleblock}{Checkpoint}
Is everything clear so far? do you have any question?

# CSV files

Python comes with a **CSV** library that we can use out of the box.
We use it by **importing** it.  **Imports** are commonly added at the
top of the file.

```python
import csv
```

# CSV files

The **csv** library is based on the idea of readers and writers.  One
can read all lines in a file like so:

```python
with open("file.csv") as f:
    reader = csv.reader(f)
    for line in reader:
        print(line)  #line will be a list here
```

. . .

first we open the file normally

. . .

Then we create a reader using **csv.reader()**

. . .

Finally, we operate with the reader

# CSV files

writing is not very different from reading:

```python
lines = [
  ["asdf", "qwer"],
  ["hello", "world"]
]

with open("file.csv", "a") as f:
    writer = csv.writer(f)
    for line in lines:
        writer.writerow(line)
```

. . .

First we need some data to put in the csv file

. . .

Then we open the file with the append mode

. . .
Later, we create a **csv.writer**

. . .

Finally, we can use the **writer.writerow()** method to add a new line
to the file.
