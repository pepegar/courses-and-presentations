## Grading

We are not applying a grading curve to this course, instead, you'll
only be graded based on your work.

| Numerical grade | Alpha grade |
|:----------------|:------------|
| < 5             | FAIL        |
| >= 5 < 7        | PASS        |
| >= 7 < 8        | PROFICIENCY |
| >= 8 < 9        | EXCELLENCE  |
| >= 9            | HONORS      |

## Participation

Please, raise your hand at any point in class if you want to ask
something, make an useful comment, or answer a question.  (if remote,
use Zoom's raise hand feature, so that it's easier to track it)

# Learning Objectives

In this course we will build the fundamentals for the rest of
the courses in the masters that rely on programming.  We will:

. . .

- Learn What's programming

. . .

- Understand how computers execute programs

. . .

- Learn the basics of Python

---

# Plan for this session

- Learn about software

. . .

- Understand what are algorithms and data structures

. . .

- Install Anaconda

---

# Language

Throughout this course we will use Python as our programming language,
but there are many more!

# Language

There are several ways for categorizing programming languages.

## Language classification

| Language   | Paradigm        | Execution   | Purpose |
|:-----------|:----------------|:------------|:--------|
| Python     | imperative      | interpreted | general |
| Java       | object oriented | compiled    | general |
| Javascript | imperative      | interpreted | general |
| Haskell    | functional      | compiled    | general |
| SQL        | declarative     | interpreted | specifi |
| HTML       | declarative     | interpreted | specifi |

# Language

## Python

Python is one of the most used languages right now.  Its applications
range from Data Science to Web servers

# How do we write code?

---

# How do we write code?

Coding is basically putting words together following a programming
language specification.

---

# How do we write code?

We can put these words directly in a text file and then execute it
as a program.

---

# How do we write code?

Or we can feed these words directly into the programming language
console.

---

# Demo

\begin{exampleblock}{Python console}
Let's see how do code looks in the console!
\end{exampleblock}

---

# Install Anaconda platform

Now we will install the Anaconda platform in our computers.

1. go to [https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
2. Go to the bottom of the page, to the **Anaconda Installers** section,
   and download the graphical installer for the 3.7 version **for your
   operating system.**
3. In the installer, when you're given the option to install the
   PyCharm IDE, or Visual Studio Code, you can ignore it, we're not
   going to use it.

# Programs

# Programs

## What is a program?

A program is a piece of software with a specific task.

. . .

This task can be something **big**, like handling a nuclear reactor, or
something **small** like Ctrl-c/Ctrl-v.

. . .

There are two main components of programs, **algorithms** & **data structures.**

# Algorithms

# Algorithms

## What is an algorithm?

. . .

An algorithm is a sequence of steps that guide the computer in how to
solve a problem

# Algorithms

What's wrong with this algorithm? why did Wolowitz need to fix it?

. . .

There was a **bug**, an infinite loop

# Spyder

Spyder is the editor we will use in this course for programming in
python, let's investigate it for a bit!

# Recap

. . .

- We'll use Python for learning programming in this course.

. . .

- Algorithms, like cooking recipes, will guide our program to perform what we want.

. . .

- We'll use the Spyder editor to program in Python

# Recommended reading

**What Is Code** is a great essay by Paul Ford. (it's a bit long, you
don't need to read it for tomorrow)
