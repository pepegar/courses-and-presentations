# HDD / SSD

>- Hard Disk Drives or Solid State Drives are the long term storage of the computer
>- Persistent

# Spyder

\begin{exampleblock}{Using Spyder}
Spyder lets you edit source code files, and run them.  Let's see how to use it!

>- **CPU** is the _computing_ part of our computer
>- **RAM** is used for the runtime of our programs to hold volatile data
>- **HDD / SSD** stores non-volatile data, it's **way** slower than RAM. (http://norvig.com/21-days.html#answers)
