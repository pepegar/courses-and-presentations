# Plan for this session

>- Learn a bit about hardware
>- Try the Spyder editor

>- It's the part of the computer capable of _computing_.
>- Speed measured in hertz
>- Moore's law (debunked)
>- More computing power is achieved through more cores

# RAM

:::: column

>- RAM is the short term memory of a computer
>- Think of it like a big shared blackboard
>- Divided in addresses
>- Not persistent
>- Fast (Random Access)

# HDD / SSD

>- Hard Disk Drives or Solid State Drives are the long term storage of the computer
>- Persistent
>- Slower than RAM
>- Higher capacity than RAM


# Development Environment

\begin{exampleblock}{Anaconda} Does everybody have Anaconda installed?\end{exampleblock}

# Spyder

# Spyder

Spyder is the editor we're going to use to develop Python programs.

>- **CPU** is the _computing_ part of our computer
>- **RAM** is used for the runtime of our programs to hold volatile data
>- **HDD / SSD** stores non-volatile data, it's **way** slower than RAM. (http://norvig.com/21-days.html#answers)
