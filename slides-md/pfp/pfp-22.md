Programming fundamentals with Python
====================================


Plan for today
==============

Computational thinking

Pattern matching

Algorithms

Decomposing

Computational thinking
======================

*If you can\'t solve a problem without programming, you can\'t solve it
with programming*

 

\- Victor Klang

Computational thinking
======================

In order to solve a problem with programming, we need to know what\'s
that problem, and what rules it follows.

 

Only then we will be able to solve it usign programming.

Computational thinking
======================

Example: Chess

 

Do you know how chess works?

\- When is a chess match won?

\- How many types of pieces there are?

\- How do they move?

\- How do they capture other pieces?

Decomposing
===========

The first step in order to solve a problem is to know which are the
steps we want to do

Decomposing
===========

What do we need to do in order to create a program to play chess?

 

\- Create a board

\- Place the pieces on the board

\- How do pieces move? and when?

\- How do pieces capture?

\- When is the game considered finished?

Pattern matching
================

When pattern matching we want to identify similarities between the
different entities that interact in the problem.

Pattern matching
================

What similarities do we find in chess?

 

Movement? capture? turns?

Algorithms
==========

The final step of computational thinking is modeling the algorithm to
resolve the problem.

Algorithms
==========

What algorithm (process) should we follow each turn in chess?
