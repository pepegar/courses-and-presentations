# Github

At this point, everybody should have an account on Github.  If you
haven't yet created one, please go ahead and create one (you can
follow the instructions in the second link of the bibliography).

# Github

Let's **create a repository on Github**!

. . .

>- Log into your github.com account
>- Create a new repository

# Github - create a new repository

# Github - linking our local repo with Github

Now that we have created this repo, it's identified with a unique URL,
we'll use the **https** url to link our local and remote repositories.

![](./img/https-url.png)

# Github - linking our local repo with Github

In order to link our local repo with Github, we will need to **set a
new remote** in our local repository:

``` {.diff}
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/popogor/my-first-repo.git
```

This will tell **git** where is the **remote repository** to which we
will upload our changes.

# Github - pushing code!

Now that we have everything set, we're ready to **push** our code to
Github!

``` {.diff}
$ git push origin master

Enumerating objects: 3, done.
Counting objects: 100% (3/3), done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 608 bytes | 608.00 KiB/s, done.
Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
To https://github.com/popogor/my-first-repo.git
 * [new branch]      master -> master
```

**git push** sends changes from the local repository to the remote one. 
It's the way we have to *upload* code to github.

# Git

## Interlude - branches

As you've seen, the latest parameter that we passed to push is
**`master`**.  That's the name of the default **branch** in git.

Branches are a way of being able to work in parallel features on the
same repository.  We're not going to use them in this course, but if
you're interested, there's a link in the bibliography.

# Github - pulling

The reverse of **pushing** is **pulling**, and that will allow us to
bring all changes **from the remote repository to our local repository.**

``` {.diff}
$ git pull origin master
```

# Solving conflicts

*Conflicts* occur naturally when coding.  Mostly when we do collaborate
with others.

 

Let's introduce a conflict and fix it ourselves!

# Solving conflicts

First, in our local copy of **my-first-repo**, let's change the
function we had to:

```python
def func(a, b):
    return a - b
```

A simple change, just modify it so it substracts instead of adding.

# Solving conflicts

And then **git add** and **git commit** it.

```bash
$ git add file.py

$ git commit -m "change function and make it substract"

[master ae46fc3] change function and make it substract
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
```

# Solving conflicts

Now let's simulate the changes someone else would make in github.

# Solving conflicts

Then, in our local repository, let's **git pull**

``` {.asciidoc}
$ git pull origin master

remote: Enumerating objects: 5, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (5/5), done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.
From https://github.com/popogor/my-first-repo
 * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
   4c659b6..e441a78  master     -> origin/master
Auto-merging file.py
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in file.py
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

# Solving conflicts

First of all, we need to see the conflicts

``` {.diff}
$ git diff

diff --cc file.py
index 64ad20f,84e4d51..0000000
--- a/file.py
+++ b/file.py
@@@ -1,3 -1,3 +1,7 @@@

  def func(a, b):
++<<<<<<< HEAD
 +    return a - b
++=======
+     return a * b
++>>>>>>> e441a78ff5f91b986f0da3afddbb7a7a01ee1859
```

# Solving conflicts

As you've seen in the last **git diff**, there are incompatible
changes in our function.  We need to make a decission, let's say that
we want to keep the multiplication.

We finish the process by doing **git add** and **git commit** after
solving the conflict, telling git we're happy with the result.

```
$ git add file.py

$ git commit -m "merged conflict in file.py"
[master 1abfd41] merged conflict in file.py
```

# Solving conflicts

``` {.diff}
$ git log

# Github classroom

**Github classroom** is the software we will use in this term to
handle, submit, and review assignments.  You will receive links like
this one, and you'll need to accept the assignments:

## Section 2

<https://classroom.github.com/a/w5ZSPW16>


## Section 3

<https://classroom.github.com/a/Meo0vyLF>

# Github classroom

When we accept an assignment in Github classroom, a new repository gets created
automatically in our Github profile.  It gets


# Cloning a project

``` {.diff}
$ git clone https://github.com/pepegar/my-first-repository.git

Cloning into 'my-first-repository'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 16, done.
remote: Total 16 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 16
Unpacking objects: 100% (16/16), done.
```

we use **git clone** to copy a repository to our local computer.
