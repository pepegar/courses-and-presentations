# Plan for today

>- Course introduction
>- Start using VS Code
>- Learn a bit about CLI tools
>- Learn about version control systems
>- Introduction to Git

# Course introduction

- **Professor**: Pepe García
- **Email**: jgarciah@faculty.ie.edu
- **Please, ask me anything**

# Course introduction. Objectives

The objectives for this course are that:

- Students learn how to use industry grade tools for programming (git, pip...)
- Students will further their knowledge of the Python programming language.
- Students understand how algorithms are designed and implemented.
- Students will learn how to work with different data structures and apply them
  to different cases.

# Course introduction. Grading

| **Section**         | **Score %** |
| ------------------- | ----------- |
| Final Exam          | 14 %        |
| Intermediate Tests  | 16 %        |
| Workgroups          | 20 %        |
| Individual Work     | 40 %        |
| Class Participation | 10 %        |

In this course we'll use alpha grading (Honors, Excellence, Proficiency, Pass,
Fail), using a normal distribution of grades and percentiles 15, 50, 85, 100.

If someone is **`2 * σ`** low, they get an automatic **Fail**

# Course introduction.  Important dates

- October 21st: Midterm 1
- November 19th: Midterm 2
- November 26th: Workgroup assignment is sent out (you'll have some days to work on it)
- December 13th: Individual assignment is out (you'll have some days to work on it)
- December 16th: Final exam

# Course introduction

## Questions?

# VS Code

Since Spyder is not working correctly for us, we'll start by changing to VS Code
editor.

https://code.visualstudio.com/

# VS Code

## Demo

Let's see how to use VS Code:

- Opening a folder to start working on it (we can drag and drop the folder to
  the editor)
- Creating files (`File > New File`, `File > Open...`)

# Installing Git

If you don't have it installed, you can get it from
**https://git-scm.com/downloads**

# Command line

The command line allows users to navigate the computer and manage it.  We can do
almost the same things with the command line and a graphical user interface.

# Command line

## Disclaimer

In this slide set, every time you see a **`$`** at the beginning of
the line it means that that's a command to be written in the terminal.

. . .

## Disclaimer 2

If you're on Mac, we will use the **Terminal** for today's session, if
you're on Windows, please open **Git Bash**.


# Listing files

We can **list files** in a folder using the **ls** command.

```
$ ls

Desktop   Documents Downloads Library   Movies    Music     Pictures  Public    opt       projects
```

# Changing directories

We change directories (move around) using **cd**.

```
$ ls

Desktop   Documents Downloads Library   Movies    Music     Pictures  Public    opt       projects

$ cd Desktop
```

# Changing directories

We can go to *upper* directories using **cd ..**

```
$ ls

Desktop   Documents Downloads Library   Movies    Music     Pictures  Public    opt       projects

$ cd Desktop

$ cd ..

$ ls

Desktop   Documents Downloads Library   Movies    Music     Pictures  Public    opt       projects
```

# Getting current directory

We can see where we are with the **pwd** command

```
$ pwd
/Users/pepe

$ cd Desktop

$ pwd
/Users/pepe/Desktop
```

##

**pwd** stands for print working directory

# Creating directories

One can create directories using the **`mkdir`** command:


```
$ pwd
/Users/pepe

$ mkdir hello_dolly

$ cd hello_dolly

$ pwd
/Users/pepe/hello_dolly
```

# Version control

## Why do we need version control software?

Have you ever found yourselves with a bunch of copies of a file (an assignment
maybe?) that you save to not loose what you've created?

# Version control

**Version control** is the process of handling programs, versions,
changes, and differences in files.

With **version control** systems we can see:

>- **Who** made changes
>- To **which files**
>- **When** did they do it
>- **Why** did they do it

The version control system we're going to use in this course is
**git**.

# Git concepts

Git terminology can be very broad, but we'll focus on the parts that
matter

# Working directory

The **working directory** is the folder in which our code will be.  The
contents of this folder will be controlled by **git**.

# Staging area

Whenever we're happy about the state of a file, we move it to the
**staging area**.  In the **staging area** we save files that are ready
to be saved.

# Local repository

The **local repository** is the place in which we store all the changes
made to all the files of our projects, over time.

# Creating our first repository

## Practice (5 mins)

- Create a folder called **my-first-repo** in your desktop
- Navigate to it using the terminal (**cd**)
- Open **VS Code**, create a python file and save it in **my-first-repo** folder
- In the terminal, initialize the repository with **git init**

# Git operations

We can always see the status of our repository:

```
$ git status

On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

file.py

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

# Git operations

We can use **git add file.py** to add the file to the staging area, in
which we store the files ready to be commited.

```
$ git add file.py

$ git status

On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

new file:   file.py
```

# Git operations

When there is a meaningful change we want to save, we use **git commit**
to save it to our local repository.

We use **git commit -m "message"** and try to use a meaningful
description of the changes we just made.

```
$ git commit -m "add file.py to git"
[master (root-commit) 123cd8b] add file.py to git
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 file.py
```

# Git concepts


# Git operations

One of the most powerful features of **git** is handling changes. 
Let's add this function to our **file.py**.

```python
def func(a, b):
    return a + b
```

# Git operations

And let's see the changes now! **git diff**

Git will show the lines we added with a **`+ sign`** before, and those we
removed with a **`- sign`**

``` {.diff}
$ git diff

diff --git a/file.py b/file.py
index e69de29..c09bd0e 100644
--- a/file.py
+++ b/file.py
@@ -0,0 +1,3 @@
+
+def func(a, b):
+    return a + b
(END)
```

In the picture we can see we added three lines

# Commit the last changes

## Practice
Now, let's commit our latest changes

# Git operations

Other of the cool features of **git** is watching the history of our
repository.  With **`git log`** we will see a log of all the changes
that happened to our repository.

```python
$ git log

commit 123cd8b45ae31065cdd7cf0ecd8ce83b444886db (HEAD -> master, origin/master)
Author: Pepe García <pepe@pepegar.com>
Date:   Mon Nov 11 23:55:49 2019 +0100

add file.py to git
```

# Github

Now, let's create an account in Github!

Go to github.com and create an account. (if you've one already, that's OK)
