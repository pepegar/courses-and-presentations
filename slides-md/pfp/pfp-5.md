Programming fundamentals with Python
====================================


Plan for today
==============

Understand bubblesort

Understand mergesort

Bubblesort
==========

Easy to implement sorting algorithm

Works by comparing pairs of numbers in the list

Has a pretty bad performance

original = \[5,3,2,24,5,1\]

``` {.lsl}
[5, 3, 2, 24, 5, 1]
[3, 5, 2, 24, 5, 1]
[3, 2, 5, 24, 5, 1]
[3, 2, 5, 24, 5, 1]
[3, 2, 5, 5, 24, 1]
[3, 2, 5, 5, 1, 24]
[2, 3, 5, 5, 1, 24]
[2, 3, 5, 5, 1, 24]
[2, 3, 5, 5, 1, 24]
[2, 3, 5, 1, 5, 24]
[2, 3, 5, 1, 5, 24]
[2, 3, 5, 1, 5, 24]
[2, 3, 1, 5, 5, 24]
[2, 3, 1, 5, 5, 24]
[2, 1, 3, 5, 5, 24]
[1, 2, 3, 5, 5, 24]
```

Now let\'s code it!

Recursion
=========

Recursion is a technique to solve problems in terms of smaller versions
of the same problem

Mergesort
=========

Mergesort uses a technique commonly known as **divide and conquer**. 
The idea behind **mergesort** is divide the list into smaller lists, and
merge them in an ordered fashion.

Mergesort
=========

*Divide and conquer algorithms try to solve the problem by dividing it
into **smaller** **subproblems**, solving them first and then combining
them.*
