# Modules

With modules, Python provides functionality to package our functions,
variables, and anything else into small packages ready to use anywhere
else.

Every time we're creating a file in Python, we're creating a module.
In order to import it we'll use its name without the `.py` extension.

# Modules

To use modules, we need the import statement:

```python
import module
```

# Modules

When we import a module, all variables in the module are evaluated, all
functions created, and top level statements executed.

. . .

\begin{exampleblock}{Example}

Let's see how importing a module will make Python evaluate everything
in it.  In the Python file at the root of the repo, import the
utilities.py file, let's see what happens.

\end{exampleblock}

# Modules


\begin{alertblock}{Warning}

As you've probably noticed, when we import a module, everything inside
it gets evaluated.

This can be dangerous if the module has statements at the top level
you're not expecting.

\end{alertblock}

# Modules

But, where does Python search for modules?

. . .

>- The directory containing the current module
>- **`sys.path`**

sys
===

sys contains functionality related with the current Python session

```python
import sys

print(sys.path)

# ['',
#  '/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Library/Frameworks/Python3.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python37.zip',
#  '/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Library/Frameworks/Python3.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7',
#  '/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Library/Frameworks/Python3.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7/lib-dynload',
#  '/Users/pepe/Library/Python/3.7/lib/python/site-packages',
#  '/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Library/Frameworks/Python3.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7/site-packages']
```

Standard library
================

The stdlib is a set of modules for a lot of different purposes

Python follows a batteries included approach, trying to give us as
programmers everything we need

Standard library
================

We have already used some modules from the standard library before:

time
====

::: columns
:::: column

The **`time`** module from the standard library contains utilities
related for dealing with time.  For example, we can use it for making
our program stop for a certain amount of time.

::::
:::: column

```python
import time

while True:
    time.sleep(1)
    print("hello!")
```

::::
:::


math
====

::: columns
:::: column

```python
import math

math.ceil(3.4)
# 4

math.floor(3.4)
# 3
```

::::
:::: column

The **`math`** module contains useful functions and constants for
doing numeric and mathematic operations

::::

# Importing

We have already seen a way of importing modules, using the **`import
module`** syntax, but there are more.

```python
from module import variable # Cherry-picking what we want to import
from module import * # importing everything from a module
import module as alias # It's possible to give alias to imported modules
```

# from ... import name

::: columns
:::: column

We can use this technique to import specific names from a module and
use them directly.

::::
:::: column

``` python
from json import dumps
print(dumps([1,2,3]))
# '[1, 2, 3]'
```

::::
:::


# from ... import *

::: columns
:::: column

``` python
from json import *
print(dumps([1,2,3]))
# '[1, 2, 3]'
```

::::
:::: column

This technique, also called wildcard import will import all names from a module.

::::
:::


# import ... as ...

::: columns
:::: {.column width=35%}

We can also rename modules when importing.  This is specially useful
whenever we will have a clash of names between imported stuff and our
current module.

::::
:::: {.column width=60%}

```python
import json as momoa
momoa.dumps({"roles":["Aquaman","Khal Drogo"]})
'{"roles": ["Aquaman", "Khal Drogo"]}'
```

# Packages

When Python projects get bigger it's common to start dividing them
into files, and when there are too many into one single directory,
into **packages**.

**Packages** are a way of organizing **modules** in Python projects.

# Packages

![](./img/PackageModuleStructure.jpg){height=250px}

# Packages

**Packages** are implemented using simple directories.  These
directories should contain a **`__init__.py`** (notice the two leading
and trailing underscores) file in order for Python to find them.

# Packages

In order to import modules from packages we will use a dot (.) as a
directory separator.

```python
import pandas.io.pickle # we're importing the pickle *module*
                        # from the pandas.io *package*

pickle("whatever")
```

# Packages

\begin{exampleblock}{Importing packages}

Let's do a quick exercise here in class.  In the python file in the
root of the repository, import the dictionary from
core/utils/data.py and print the second
element.

\end{exampleblock}

# Recap

>- Import modules with import
>- Create our own modules as files
>- stdlib contains a lot of useful stuff
>- third party libs can help when something is not on stdlib
