Programming fundamentals with Python
====================================


Plan for today
==============

Path finding in graphs

Weighted graphs

Lab session

Pathfinding
===========


Pathfinding
===========

Let\'s implement a path finding algorithm for our directed graphs from
last session

Pathfinding
===========

Pathfinding
===========

We\'ve seen the **find\_path** function.  Create a function for finding
all paths now!

Weighted graphs
===============

Weighted graphs are graphs in which the edges have a weight.  Imagine a
graph describing distances between points in space, that\'s a weighted
graph.

Weighted graphs
===============

How would you model a **directed weighted graph** in Python?

Weighted graphs
===============

Modify the **find\_path** function to make it work on weighted graphs.
