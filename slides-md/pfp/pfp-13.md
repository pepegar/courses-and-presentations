Programming fundamentals with Python
====================================


Plan for today
==============

Understand **Object Oriented Programming**

Learn the difference between **objects** and **classes**

Modeling data with classes

Modelling functionality with **methods**

Object Oriented Programming
===========================

**OOP** is a programming paradigm that uses objects to encapsulate code
and data

**OOP** is really useful for us because we can map almost everything we
know to an object, we just need to know its attributes and its
functionality.

Object Oriented Programming
===========================

**Classes** are templates for objects

**Objects** are instances of classes

**Attributes** describe the characteristics of an object

**Methods** model functionality in an object

Classes
=======

**Classes** are **descriptions for objects**, which we can instantiate
later.

Classes can describe the **attributes** of an object, the functions it
has (called **methods**)

Classes
=======

We use the **class** keyword to declare classes:

```python
class Car:
    pass
```

Classes
=======

We can create an indefinite number of objects from the class:

```python
car1 = Car()
car2 = Car()
#...
car23493 = Car()

# What will this print?
print(car1 == car2)
```

Classes
=======

When we create classes we are creating a new type with them!

```python
car = Car()

print(type(car))
```

Constructing objects
====================

The construction of objects from a class is handled by something called
the **\_\_init\_\_** method

Constructing objects
====================

```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self):
        pass
```

Constructing objects
====================

The init method is executed when we instantiate the object, and we can
use it to add attributes to our class:

```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, brand, model):
        self.brand = brand
        self.model = model
```

Constructing objects
====================

It is a common thing to add validation logic to the **\_\_init\_\_**
method.

```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, brand, model):
        if brand != "Ford" or brand != "Audi":
            raise ValueError("Don't know how to create a {}".format(brand))
      
        self.brand = brand
        self.model = model
```

Practice
========

Create a class that represents a clock.  It should contain **hours** and
**minutes** only.

 

Validate that the attributes passed to the constructor make sense.

Constructing objects
====================

```python
mondeo = Car("Ford", "Mondeo")
a3 = Car("Audi", "A3")

print(a3.brand)
print(mondeo.model)
```

Methods
=======

Methods model functionality in our objects.

 

They are like functions, but they must receive a self parameter before
others:

Methods
=======

```python
class Car:
    started = False

    def __init__(self, brand, model):
        self.brand = brand
        self.model = model

    def start_engine(self):
        self.started = True

    def stop_engine(self):
        self.started = False
```

Methods
=======

```python
car = Car("Ford", "Mondeo")
print(car.started)

car.start_engine()
print(car.started)

car.stop_engine()
print(car.started)
```

Recap
=====

**class** != **object**

**attribute** != **method**

**\_\_init\_\_** is for constructing objects

Methods
=======

Let\'s model a **Rock band**:

\- RockBand

  - add\_member()

  - rehearse()

\- Member

  - name

  - instrument

  - play()

Session 2
=========

-   Learn about inheritance
-   visibility and encapsulation

Inheritance
===========

With inheritance we can create hierarchies of classes that share
**attributes ** and **methods**.

Inheritance
===========


Inheritance
===========

When declaring a class that **extends** another class (meaning it
**inherits** from it), we put the parent class between parentheses

```python
class ClassName(Parent):
    pass
```

Inheritance
===========

When we inherit classes, the methods from the parents are inherited too!

```python
class Vehicle:
    def start(self):
        print("BRROOOMMMMM!")
        
class Car(Vehicle):
    pass
  
car = Car()
car.start()
```

Here we declare a normal class, with a simple **start** method

So we can use methods from the parent in the child class

Method overriding
=================

Something else we can do with **Inheritance** is method overriding.

 

**Method overriding** allows us to change the behavior of methods in a
child class, let\'s see an example.

Method overriding
=================

```python
class Vehicle:
    def start(self):
        print("BRROOOMMMMM!")
        
class Car(Vehicle):
    pass
  
class Tesla(Car):
    def start(self):
        print("blip!")
```

```python
vehicle = Vehicle()
vehicle.start()

car = Car()
car.start()

tesla = Tesla()
tesla.start()
```

Practice
========

Create a class **Polygon** with a method **calculate\_area()**.

 

Create two subclasses of it, **Square** and  **Circle** that override
the **calculate\_area** method.

type vs isinstance
==================

Now that we\'re introducing bigger class hierarchies, we need to be
aware of the differences between **type()** and **isinstance()**

type vs isinstance
==================

**type** returns the class we used to instantiate the object

```python
type(tesla) == Vehicle
# returns False

isinstance(tesla, Vehicle)
# returns True 
```

**isinstance** returns True if the class is in the hierarchy of the
object

type vs isinstance
==================

Creating our own Exceptions
===========================

We can create our own exceptions by creating a class that inherits from
an exception:

```python
class FormValidationError(ValueError):
    pass
  
if not is_valid(email):
    raise FormValidationError()
```

Calling methods from the parent class
=====================================

Inside a class, we can use the **super()** function in order to access
the parent class.

 

**super()** is very useful to extend the functionality of methods in the
superclass.

Calling methods from the parent class
=====================================

```python
class Polygon:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        
class Triangle():
    def __init__(self, base, height):
        super().__init__("triangle")
        self.base = base
        self.height = height
```

Encapsulation
=============

We use encapsulation to hide the internal state of an object from the
outside.

 

Attributes or methods that are hidden from the outside, we call them
**private**.

 

In order to declare a method or attribute as private, we use the prefix
**\_\_ (double underscore)**

Encapsulation
=============

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.__name = name
        
pepe = Person("Pepe")
pepe.__name
#AttributeError: 'Person' object has no attribute '__name'
```

The class **Person** has a **private attribute** **\_\_name.**

Encapsulation
=============

But, what do we do if we want to access a private attribute from the
outside?

 

A common technique is to use a **getter method**

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.__name = name
        
    def get_name(self):
        return self.__name
        
pepe = Person("Pepe")
pepe.get_name()
# "Pepe"
```
