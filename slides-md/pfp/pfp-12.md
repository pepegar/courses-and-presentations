# Recursion

Recursion is a technique to solve problems in terms of smaller versions of the
same problem.

. . .

In computer science we use it when a function calls itself:

. . .

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)
```

An example of a recursive algorithm is the calculation of a number in the
Fibonacci sequence.

Remember that Fibonacci goes like this:

**0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13...**

. . .

\begin{exampleblock}{Fibonacci}

Let's implement the calculation of a number in the Fibonacci sequence using recursion!

# Recursion

Something that we have to consider is that all problems that we solve using
recursion can be solved using iteration.

. . .

\begin{block}{Homework}

Try implementing the previous function using iteration instead of recursion!

# Divide and conquer

From Wikipedia:

_Divide and conquer_ is a technique used **in algorithmia** in which we split a
problem into smaller sub-problems recursively until they're simple enough to be
solved directly.

# Mergesort

The idea behind **mergesort** is fairly simple.  What if we had a way of
splitting an unsorted list into smaller ones, and then merging them together in
a sorted fashion?

. . .

A question we need to agree on before jumping into the implementation...

- **Is a list of only one element sorted?**

. . .

Yes, it is!

# Mergesort

# Mergesort

In our mergesort implementation we will have two different functions.
**`merge`**, that will just take two **sorted** lists and merge them into a new
sorted list, and **`mergesort`**, that will perform the splitting of the list
and call **`merge`** on the smaller lists.

. . .

\begin{exampleblock}{Mergesort}
Let's implement mergesort!

What's the worst case runtime for mergesort?  Why?
