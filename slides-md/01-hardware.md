## Moore's law

> Moore's law is the observation that the number of transistors in a

> law is an observation and projection of a historical trend. Rather
> than a law of physics, it is an empirical relationship linked to
> gains from experience in production.

# CPU

\begin{alertblock}{Moore's law}

Nowadays, although the number of transistors in chips is still
increasing over the years, the pace has slowed down.  The way we're
achieving faster speeds nowadays is by having more cores working at
the same time.

Not this _Random Access Memories_...

>- RAM is the short term memory of a computer
>- Think of it like a big shared blackboard
>- Divided in addresses
>- Not persistent.  _if computer is powered down, contents are lost_

# HDD / SSD

>- Hard Disk Drives or Solid State Drives are the long term storage of the computer
>- Persistent
>- Slower than RAM

Spyder is the editor we're going to use to develop Python programs.

# Spyder

\begin{exampleblock}{Using Spyder}
Spyder lets you edit source code files, and run them.  Let's see how to use it!
\end{exampleblock}

# Recap.  What happens when Spyder runs a file?

\begin{exampleblock}{Whiteboard}
Let's understand what happens in under the hoodour computer when we
run a file in Spyder.
\end{exampleblock}

# Review

>- **CPU** is the _computing_ part of our computer
>- **RAM** is used for the runtime of our programs to hold volatile data
>- **HDD / SSD** stores non-volatile data, it's **way** slower than RAM. (http://norvig.com/21-days.html#answers)
