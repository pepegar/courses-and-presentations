## Moore's law

> Moore's law is the observation that the number of transistors in a

# CPU

\begin{alertblock}{Moore's law}

Nowadays, although the number of transistors in chips is still
increasing over the years, the pace has slowed down.  The way we're
achieving faster speeds nowadays is by having more cores working at
the same time.

# Recap.  What happens when Spyder runs a file?

\begin{exampleblock}{Whiteboard}
Let's understand what happens in under the hood of our computer when we run a Python file

# Review

. . .

>- **CPU** is the _computing_ part of our computer
>- **RAM** is used for the runtime of our programs to hold volatile data
>- **HDD / SSD** stores non-volatile data, it's **way** slower than RAM. (http://norvig.com/21-days.html#answers)
