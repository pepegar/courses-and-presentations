# About

## Grading

This course is graded as NGS/NGU, and the note will depend on the final exam.

The final exam consists of multiple choice/multiple answer questions, and is open book.

| Criteria   | Score % |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Final Exam | 100 %   |

# About

## Grading

The grading for this course will either be **Non Graded Satisfactory** or **Non
Graded Unsatisfactory**.

If you get 50% or more in the overall score, you get **NGS**, and **NGU**
otherwise.

# About

\begin{exampleblock}{Participation}
Please, raise your hand at any point in class if you want to ask something, make
an useful comment, or answer a question.  (if remote, use Zoom's raise hand
feature, so that it's easier to track it)

# Learning Objectives

In this course we will build the fundamentals for the rest of the courses in the
masters that rely on programming.  We will:

. . .

- Learn What's programming

. . .

- Understand how computers execute programs

. . .

- Learn the basics of Python

---

# Plan for this session

- Know each other a little bit!

. . .


- Learn about software

. . .

- Understand what are algorithms and data structures

. . .

- Install Anaconda

Throughout this course we will use Python as our programming language, but there
are many more!

# Languages

There are several ways of classifying programming languages.

## Languages classification

| Language   | Paradigm        | Execution   | Purpose  |
| :--------- | :-------------- | :---------- | :------- |
| Python     | imperative      | interpreted | general  |
| Java       | object oriented | compiled    | general  |
| Javascript | imperative      | interpreted | general  |
| Haskell    | functional      | compiled    | general  |
| SQL        | declarative     | interpreted | specific |
| HTML       | declarative     | interpreted | specific |

# Languages

## Python

Python is one of the most used languages right now.  Its applications range from
Data Science to Web servers

# How do we write code?

---

# How do we write code?

Coding is basically putting words together following a programming language
specification.

---

# How do we write code?

Usually, we put these words directly in a text file and then execute it as a program.

![](./img/code.jpg){height=70%}

---

# How do we write code?

But we can feed these words directly into the programming language **console**.

---

# Demo

\begin{exampleblock}{Python console}
Let's see how we can use the console to code!
\end{exampleblock}

---

# Install Anaconda platform

Now we will install the Anaconda platform in our computers.

1. go to [https://www.anaconda.com/download](https://www.anaconda.com/download)
2. Download Anaconda distribution for your computer.

# Install Anaconda platform

\begin{exampleblock}{Checkpoint}
Is anybody lost or has problems installing the software?
\end{exampleblock}

# Programs

# Programs

## What is a program?

A program is a piece of software with a specific task.

. . .

This task can be something **big**, like handling a nuclear reactor, or
something **small** like Ctrl-c/Ctrl-v.

. . .

There are two main components of programs, **algorithms** & **data structures.**

# Algorithms

# Algorithms

## What is an algorithm?

. . .

An algorithm is a sequence of steps that guide the computer in how to solve a
problem

# Algorithms

What's wrong with this algorithm? why did Wolowitz need to fix it?

. . .

There was a **bug**, an infinite loop

# Data structures

We use different data structures depending what we want to represent.

- Strings: text
- Lists: Twitter's timeline
- Dictionaries: phonebook, DNS
- Stacks: undo/redo
...

# Recap

. . .

- We'll use Python for learning programming in this course.

. . .

- Algorithms, like cooking recipes, will guide our program to perform what we
  want.

. . .

- Different data structures will be used depending on the purpose of our program.

**What Is Code** is a great essay by Paul Ford. (it's a bit long, you don't need
to read it for tomorrow)
