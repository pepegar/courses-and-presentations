Data Structures & Programmatic Thinking
=======================================


Plan for today
==============

Lists

For loops

Lists
=====

Lists are sequences of values


Constructing Lists
==================

We construct lists with the brackets \[\] syntax:

    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    ["hello", "dolly"]
    []
    [1, "hello", 2, "dolly", 3]

Constructing Lists
==================

Accessing list elements
=======================

We use **square brackets** to access elements by their **index**.

 

**indices** in lists start by **0**, not 1.

    words = ["hello", "dolly"]
    words[0]
    # "hello"
    words[1]
    # "dolly"

Accessing List elements
=======================

Operators on lists
==================

As with strings, + and \* operators work with lists too!

Operators on lists
==================

Mutating lists
==============

Lists are mutable values, and they provide functionality to add, delete,
and update elements

Updating elements in the list
=============================

To update an element inside the list, we use a syntax similar to the one
for declaring variables, but using the brackets and the index we refer
to.

    numbers = [1,2,4]
    numbers[2] = 3
    print(numbers)

Updating elements in the list
=============================

Appending elements to the list
==============================

To add a new element to the end of the list we use the append() method
on it.

    numbers = [1,2,3]
    numbers.append(4)
    print(numbers)

Appending elements to the list
==============================

Inserting elements in the list
==============================

There\'s an alternative way of adding new elements to the list, and
it\'s using the insert() method on it:

    words = ["hello","my","friends"]
    words.insert(2, "dear")
    print(words)

The difference between this and append is that with insert we can choose
where to put it by using the target index

Inserting elements in the list
==============================

Removing elements from the list
===============================

In order to remove an element from a list, we should use the .pop()
method, and pass the index of the element we want to remove

    words = ["hello","my","friend"]
    words.pop(1)
    print(words)

Removing elements from the list
===============================

For loops
=========

For loops are simpler than while loops. They iterate over elements in a
list.

For loops
=========

```python
for <variable_name> in <list>:
    <body>
```

For loops
=========

Recap
=====

Use lists to store collections of values

Use mutation operations on list to add, remove, or update elements in
the list

Use for loops to iterate over elements in the list

Exercises
=========

``` {.lsl}
1. Create a function that returns a list of numbers from 0 to 500

2. Create a function that takes a list of numbers (you can use the one
   you created in the previous exercise) and returns the sum of all of
   them

3. Investigate the ~range()~ function.  After you've used it, create a
   function that receives a number as parameter and prints all numbers
   from it to zero (using a for loop).

4. Create a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the
   maximum value among them

5. Create a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the
   minimum value among them
```
